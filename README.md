# Veterinary Clinic Database – School Project (in Spanish)
This is a school project developed in Spanish, designed to create a relational database system for a veterinary clinic that provides medical care to companion animals such as dogs and cats.

The system is built to manage:
	
        •	🐶 Pet records, including species, breed, weight, size, birthdate, and full owner information.
	
        •	📅 Appointment scheduling, tracking veterinarians, reasons for visit, and type of consultation (emergency or routine). Includes a stored procedure to automatically assign available vets.
	
        •	🩺 Consultations, allowing veterinarians to record diagnoses and treatments, using a species-based disease catalog, and triggers to update availability in case of cancellations.
	
        •	👩‍⚕️ Veterinary staff and secretaries, storing credentials, contact details, and secure login with encrypted passwords.
	
        •	🛒 Product inventory and sales, managing items like medications, food, toys, and accessories. Includes triggers for low-stock alerts and functions for inventory reports.
	
        •	📊 Reports and statistics through stored procedures: best-selling and least-selling products, monthly sales summaries, and veterinarian of the month.
	
        •	👁️ Views for daily consultations per vet and products not purchased by a specific client.
	
        •	🔄 Transactions to ensure data integrity during sales.
	
        •	🔐 Security measures for safe access and minimal-privilege users, ensuring 24/7 availability.


📌 This project is entirely written in Spanish due to being part of a university-level course.

# Veterinary Clinic Database – School Project (in Spanish)
This is a school project developed in Spanish, designed to create a relational database system for a veterinary clinic that provides medical care to companion animals such as dogs and cats.

The system is built to manage:

- 🐶 **Pet records**, including species, breed, weight, size, birthdate, and full owner information.

- 📅 **Appointment scheduling**, tracking veterinarians, reasons for visit, and type of consultation (emergency or routine). Includes a **stored procedure** to automatically assign available vets.

- 🩺 **Consultations**, allowing veterinarians to record diagnoses and treatments, using a species-based disease catalog, and **triggers** to update availability in case of cancellations.

- 👩‍⚕️ **Veterinary staff and secretaries**, storing credentials, contact details, and secure login with **encrypted passwords**.

- 🛒 **Product inventory and sales**, managing items like medications, food, toys, and accessories. Includes **triggers for low-stock alerts** and **functions for inventory reports**.

- 📊 **Reports and statistics** through stored procedures: best-selling and least-selling products, monthly sales summaries, and veterinarian of the month.

- 👁️ **Views** for daily consultations per vet and products not purchased by a specific client.

- 🔄 **Transactions** to ensure data integrity during sales.

- 🔐 **Security measures** for safe access and minimal-privilege users, ensuring **24/7 availability**.

📌 This project is entirely written in Spanish due to being part of a university-level course.
